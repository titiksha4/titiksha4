<h1 align="center">Hi , I'm Titiksha Jain</h1>
<p align="center" style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.4; color: #666;">
  With over 5 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in crafting clean, reliable data pipelines that help businesses unlock the true value of their data. I work extensively with cloud platforms and tools like Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Delta Lake to build modern data solutions. Certified by both Databricks, I’m committed to continuous learning and staying ahead in this fast-evolving field. At the core, I’m driven by curiosity and the desire to solve complex data challenges in simple, effective ways.
